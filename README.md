Please have at least one window with Salesforce visible on screen else the chat alert will not work.

<h2>Description

<h5>With Salesforce, the commitments will appear in silent and sometimes behind the window that you are currently working on. This has been an ongoing issue that puts Support members to refuse. I developed a Chrome extension as a workaround to this.

<h2>How it works 

<h5>This extension will listen for any window with Salesforceâ€™s unique link for commitments. When this unique link appears, Commitment Alerts will launch another window following a link that was either set or defaulted with sound. The user may then close the window and start the commitment. You can essentially set any link that you want to appear when a commitment opens; I recommend using a YouTube link or a website with sound auto-playing for optimal use of the extension.

<h2>Notes

<h5>-This extension will only work for Raptor Technologies because of the special link that Raptor uses in Salesforce.
<h5>-Commitments are cases from the queue that appears the to agent for 2 minutes. If the agent does not confirm the commitment within the given time, it will put the agent to refusal status.

<h2>Update

<h5>-This extension now supports sending alerts via Telegram. Developed bots to gather chat ID with python.
<h5>-This extension has been updated to also alert for Raptor's chat interface.
